## Project 1: Classification of Breast Cancer Data using Neural Networks

### Description

UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

Attribute Information:

- ID number
- Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant

- sqft_living - Square footage of the apartments interior living space
- sqft_lot - Square footage of the land space
- floors - Number of floors
- waterfront - A dummy variable for whether the apartment was overlooking the waterfront or not
- view - An index from 0 to 4 of how good the view of the property was
- condition - An index from 1 to 5 on the condition of the apartment,
- grade - An index from 1 to 13, where 1-3 falls short of building construction and design, 7 has an average level of construction and design, and 11-13 have a high quality level of construction and design.
- sqft_above - The square footage of the interior housing space that is above ground level
